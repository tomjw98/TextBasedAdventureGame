This project is a text based adventure game influenced by the popular Japanese action role-playing game
Dark Souls. In this game, you choose between 3 different classes; warrior, cleric and assassin. Each class
has its own attributes and play styles. For example, Warrior has higher damage while the cleric has more
healing potions with a higher amount of health. The assassin on the other hand has the highest dodge chance
in addition to the highest critical hit chance. Each class also has its own unique buff to give yourself an advantage
while playing.

The aim of the game is simple, survive for as many rounds as you can. This will be done by managing your health and
potions while also trying to do as much damage as possible. Every 5th round is a boss battle so make sure you're fully
healed before fighting them!
